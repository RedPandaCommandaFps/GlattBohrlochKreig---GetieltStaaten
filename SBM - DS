GlattBohrlochKreig - Getielt Staaten is a Cold War Tank game about 2 Brothers who
  were split up due to units in Germany going to different sides of the wall
  (Berlin Wall) during the Cold War. This Will be the story part of the game.
  No coding yet. I'm just trying to get 20 Missions 30 minutes at least.
  This game is slightly True and fictional. Actual Tanks. Actual Names and real
  locations Will be used. But timeline and other things will be modified. If you
  want to jump on its open to all.
